# Boxed Monaco Editor

The human DNA, comprised of approximately 3.5 billion base pairs, equates to about 750 Megabytes of data. This constitutes all the information necessary to construct a human being. Moreover, it encapsulates the instructions on how to interpret this data.

When I first compiled the Monaco Editor, the sum of all generated files amounted to around 1.4 Gigabytes - twice the size of the source code required for human construction! This includes files produced for testing, files created for various bundling systems like webpack, vite, parcel, among others, and files to support different programming languages in the editor. For sure, it is not only for the editor in itself. Nevertheless, it still represents a significant level of complexity. One would say more complexity than needed for a browser-based code editor - which, by the way, is quite impressive!

Instead of re-engineering the entire thing, I have endeavored to box this complexity into a single JavaScript file that can be utilized with vanilla JavaScript, without the need to understand and research ways to do it, which, to be fair, exist.
